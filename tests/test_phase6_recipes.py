"""Phase 6 / S4 — sanity tests for the 2×2 factorial recipe matrix.

Validates ``recipes/cec_phase6_{C00,C10,C01,C11}.yaml``:

* every recipe loads and projects to a JAX config without raising;
* ``TOPOLOGY_BANK`` length is 0 (no bank) or 16 (full bank), per arm;
* every path in a configured ``TOPOLOGY_BANK`` exists on disk;
* ``MISSION_BANK`` is ``None`` (no bank) or matches the plan's 4-entry
  default ``[(1,1,1), (3,1,1), (1,3,1), (1,1,3)]`` with amplify=1.0.

The 2×2 factorial (per plans/jax/cc4/cec/cec-phase6-plan.md):

    | arm | topology bank | mission bank |
    | --- | ------------- | ------------ |
    | C00 | (none)        | (none)       |
    | C10 | 16 snapshots  | (none)       |
    | C01 | (none)        | 4-entry      |
    | C11 | 16 snapshots  | 4-entry      |
